For this delivery, a modified avatar is introduced into our final project.

In this work-in-progress, the user can select four different zones using their two wrists and two feet.

The avatar is modified and positioned such that it can easily reach for these zones.

On contact, the avatar goes through the sphere gameObjects. But if we make the spheres solid, the avatar will also kinematically interact with them.
